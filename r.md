## Aim 1 
Evaluate coordination between home visitation programs and other support services 

**A: Reduction in duplication of services for any particular client**

**B: Develop timeline and analytic covariates that chronicle major program events**

**C: Evaluate the frequency of referrals coming into EBHV agencies**

## Aim2 
Evaluate outreach effort of MIECHV-funded marketing strategies 

**A: Survey large sector of eligible population for knowledge, use, and appeal of EBHV services**

**B: Identify marketing successes/failures among client focus group participant responses**

## Aim 3 
Evaluate engagement and retention of clients in EBHV services 

**A: Continually evaluate the flow of clients served per county**

**B: Identify reasons for low engagement in services**

**C: Examine provider barriers to program implementation with families that do not engage**

**D: Evaluate effectiveness of new engagement enhancement strategies**

**E: Identify reasons for attrition from services**

**F: Evaluate effectiveness of new retention strategies**

## Aim 4 
Evaluate overall need for child and family services among disadvantaged early childhood populations within each community 

**A: Epidemiologic assessment of home visitation services need**

**B: Epidemiologic assessment of developmental delays**

**C: Epidemiologic assessment of child sexual behavior problems**

**D: Epidemiologic assessment of child abuse and neglect potential **

## Aim 5 
Establish a quality improvement and control system and evaluate effectiveness of the home visitation and early childhood services continuum 

**A: Compare EBHV and Community for targeted MIECHV benchmarks and constructs from EBHV clients**

**B: Identify system improvements and necessary quality controls through client focus groups, staff and leadership qualitative interviews, and expert systems consultations**

**C: Implement and evaluate system of quality improvements and controls**

## Auxiliary Aims 
There was a need to examine other questions and distribute the reports to stakeholders. The reports in this collection do not fit cleanly in the investigationâ€™s five formal aims. 

**A: Show spatial-temporal conditions**
