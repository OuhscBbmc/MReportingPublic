# Overview

Project Duration: 2011-2015

> Evaluates MIECHV expansion and enhancement of Evidence-based Home Visitation programs in four Oklahoma counties.

This page contains the products from the 2011 funded proposal, [HRSA/ACF D89MC23154](https://perf-data.hrsa.gov/mchb/DGISReports/Abstract/AbstractDetails.aspx?Source=TVIS&GrantNo=D89MC23154&FY=2012): "OUHSC CCAN Independent Evaluation of the State of Oklahoma Competitive Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Project."

# Brief Summary of External Evaluation Aims
Oklahoma's Maternal, Infant, Early Childhood Home Visitation (MIECHV) Expansion project has two primary branches  of evaluation, the *internal* evaluation conducted by the Oklahoma State Dept. of Health (OSDH) and the *external* evaluation conducted by the OU Health Sciences Center, Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (CCAN).  This summary report describes the progress to date for the external evaluation which uses a mixed‚Äêmethod (quantitative/qualitative) approach to inform and evaluate change in five specific targeted areas identified for improvement: 

## 1. Systems Coordination
 Evaluate the impact of existing and developing coordination between EBHV programs and other support services. 
 
## 2. Program Marketing
 Inform, develop, and evaluate the outreach efforts of MIECHV-funded marketing.
 
## 3. Client Enrollment and Retention
Inform, develop, and evaluate new methods for engagement and retention of clients in EBHV services.

## 4. Service Need
Evaluate the overall need for child and family services within each community. 

## 5. HV Effectiveness and Improvement
Establish a quality improvement and control system and evaluate effectiveness of the home visitation and early childhood services continuum.

## Impact
These five targeted aims of the evaluation intersect with all four of the national MIECHV areas of relevance.  The data obtained and evaluated will inform program planning and implementation (aims 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5), will evaluate effectiveness of planned strategies that are intended to enhance and sustain implementation (aims 1, 2, 3, & 5), will evaluate the capacity to support and monitor quality of scaled up evidence-based (EB) home visitation service continuum (aim 1), and will assess the effectiveness of home visitation on key outcomes that overlap with the national MIECHV benchmarks and constructs (aim 5).

# Evaluation Implementation Strategy
The overall analysis is progressing from a set of general inquiries to a set of focused protocol subaims.  Our current reports do not map 1-to-1 to our protocol subaims.  Our intermediate reporting structure allows us to communicate better with stakeholders and other researchers (because the organization of issues can be different from their perspective).  The reports are currently structured so that we can approach others with a single document, instead of several scattered documents. Consequently, the following subaims are frequently addressed by several reports, and multiple subaims can refer to a common report.  By the conclusion of our external evaluation, each subaim will be addressed by a single, exclusive report.

We use a literate programming framework and code repository that facilitates agile and reproducible research.  We invite readers to view the analysis code and resulting documents housed in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OuhscCcanMiechvEvaluation/MReporting).  However, we ask that you not pass the GitHub  username and password to anyone who did not received it from us.  If you know someone who would like to review the repository, please have them contact [us](william-beasley@ouhsc.edu) and we likely will grant them permission. (Even with the username, no PHI is accessible from the repository; an authorized OUHSC user account is required.)
