# History of [MIECHV](http://www.ok.gov/health/Child_and_Family_Health/Family_Support_and_Prevention_Service/MIECHV_Program_-_Federal_Home_Visiting_Grant/MIECHV_Program_Resources/index.html) in Oklahoma

*Background*: This report is part of [Oklahoma's External Evaluation of MIECHV](http://ouhscbbmc.github.io/MReportingPublic). "The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting project supports pregnant women and families and helps at-risk parents of children from birth to kindergarten entry tap the resources and hone the skills they need to raise children who are physically, socially and emotionally healthy and ready to learn" ([HRSA, 2015](http://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs/homevisiting/)). Oklahoma's current focus is to expand services and explore the effectiveness of different approaches.  For more details about the project, please see our [website](http://ouhscbbmc.github.io/MReportingPublic/) and [list of reports](http://ouhscbbmc.github.io/MReportingPublic/research_2011a.html).

2013<br/>May 19   <b>Washington Post Publishes Article Supporting Home-Visitation</b><br/>Home visiting programs are preschool in its earliest form. <br/>The brain develops more in the first few years than at any other time in life, and studies have identified an achievement gap as early as nine months into a child's life, separating those from rich households and those from poor households, which tend to be more stressful and less stimulating environments. By the time children are 2 or 3 years old, the gap is more pronounced in the size of their vocabularies, their social skills and their emotional abilities, such as to calm down and focus. All are key predictors of later school success. <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/home-visiting-programs-are-preschool-in-its-earliest-form/2013/05/19/e979b342-b8b9-11e2-b94c-b684dda07add_story.html'  target='_blank'>[Pew press release]</a>
