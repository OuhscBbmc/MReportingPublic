# R utilities for interacting with a REDCap data system

The [REDCap](http://www.project-redcap.org/) database system is a critical piece in Oklahoma's MIECHV evaluation.  It serves the two databases used in the community survey, and its recruitment.  Our statisticians use primarily [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and its software libraries for analysis.  Consequently we developed some routines that assisted the import and export operations with REDCap and R.  

In the summer of 2013, we noticed an overall gap faced by other statisticians using REDCap and R, and released **REDCapR** package to help address this unmet need.  In its first year, this open-source project was a featured presentation in the national [REDCap Conference](https://starbrite.vanderbilt.edu/rocket/index.php?doc_id=8580), and attracted independent [contributors](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/graphs/contributors) and users (many who also receive DHHS funding).  The stable version is released on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REDCapR/index.html), while the development version is hosted on the collaborative site, [GitHub](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR).
