In the final year of the evaluation, two  methods for assessing the effectiveness of home visiting (HV) in Oklahoma will 
be examined. A quasi-experimental comparison of effectiveness will be conducted using a propensity scoring approach for 
matching the (potentially non-equivalent) HV client sample and the subset of unexposed (to HV) community survey participants. 
These groups will be compared on many of the earmarked MIECHV benchmarks and constructs.  A detailed cross-walk map between 
the client MIECHV outcome measures and the survey's MIECHV measures can be found here: <Insert Donnas crosswalk here>.  
In addition to this quasi-experimental comparison, an instrumental variable approach for assessing a randomized treatment 
effect will be conducted to explore differences between a random subgroup of the survey participants who were strongly 
encouraged to enroll in HV to a subgroup randomly assigned to a weak encouragement condition (for more details on each 
study condition, please refer to the latest protocol here: <Insert Study Protocol Link>).  This comparison will also rely 
on the earmarked MIECHV benchmark and construct outcomes. Initial results from both types of comparisons will be posted 
here, so please check back soon.
