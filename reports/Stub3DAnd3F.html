As part of an ongoing Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) initiative, the OU CCAN and the OSDH evaluation teams 
have been tasked with finding new strategies for improving client enrollment and retention. These teams have 
adopted a Best Practices approach to the search methodology, which began with the construction of a process diagram
for home visiting workflows (can be viewed here: <INSERT LINK TO PROCESS DIAGRAM>). Then, based in part on the Positive Deviance approach (see www.positivedeviance.org) for 
Best Practices research, these teams performed a number of site visits and qualitative interviews with top performing 
C1 agencies and individual providers (nurse home visitors).  Results from these qualitative investigations have been summarized and the 
next phase of the BP research, the testing phase, is ready to begin examing effectiveness of the identified strategies.  
Initial findings will be posted here, so please check back soon.
