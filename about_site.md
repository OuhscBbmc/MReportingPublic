## Components
This website is maintained by [OUHSC Pediatrics](./about_collaborators.html#ouhsc-pediatrics), with the input of the investigation [collaborators](./about_collaborators.html).  None of the reports contain [PHI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information), or fined-grained area information that could identify a participant or client.

The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  It is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (and heavily relied on the latter when forming the site's structure).  The majority of the static reports are created with  [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), while the interactive reports are created with [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/); both use 
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) as a foundation.

## Historical Archives
To increase transparency and promote reproducibility, this website is assigned a unique [DOI](http://www.doi.org/) (digital object identifier) after each substantial modification.  Each major version is archived (and [available for download indefinitely](https://zenodo.org/search?ln=en&p=MReportingPublic)) on a third-party site --where we cannot modify it.  The DOI of the current version is [10.5281/zenodo.12234](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12234).
